# EPIC-Earth-gif-maker
Small Python script to create a .gif of the Earth spinning.  

Here's a small Python script built to grab the latest images from NASAs EPIC Earth instrument and build a .gif of the world spinning.  Simply run file and input quality desired to build a .gif in same directory.  

By uncommenting where specified it will resize images from quality to set size.

Note: No compression is used, .gif files are large to keep quality high
